## Devnet 0.2 Mini Technical FAQ
Q: My node stopped syncing. I waited a long time but the current layer doesn't advance. What should I do?

A: Stop the node process by pressing `ctrl-c` in the terminal window you started the node at. Delete local node data folder `~/spacemesh/<devnet_id>/` and proof of spacetime data from your post directory if you created any, and start it again.

---

Q: I've setup smeshing via smrepl and I later restarted the node and now it is not smeshing. How can I keep smeshing after a node restart?

A: After setting post in smrepl, you need to modify your node's config file with the smeshing parameters so your node can continue smeshing using these parameters after you restart it.

---

Q: I'm getting an error when starting the node on Windows about missing C++ runtime.
A: Install the latest Visual C++ runtime from Microsoft and try again.
