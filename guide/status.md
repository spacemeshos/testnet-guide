# Checking Smesher Status

Open the App, if it is not already open, and click on the `SMESHER` tab on the top-left of the main window.

You should now see your Smesher status screen:

This screen is where you will track your Smesher operation, and view your total rewards.

You can also pause (or un-pause) your Smesher by clicking on the `PAUSE NODE` button.


Click the CLOSE button in the App's main Window.

You will be prompted to quit the app or to switch it to run in the background. Choose `Keep running in background` so that your Smesher will continue to run and to smesh blocks.

### Smesh rewards Expectancy

> If you have committed storage and left your app running 24/7, and your network is [properly configured](../netconfig.md) then you should expect your first Smesh reward in about 49 hours.

?> Remember to leave your computer running 24/7 to fully participate in the Spacemesh platform and get Smesh rewards for your contribution.

## Well Done!

You did it - you are now up and running a Smesher, and you will start receiving Smesh rewards for producing blocks to the Spacemesh platform.
